This is my entry for Ludum Dare #26, theme "Minimalism". It also
serves as my April entry for One Game a Month!  Win-win!

CONTROLS:
Keyboard:   A to shoot, arrow keys to move
360 gamepad:  A to shoot, analog stick to move

The game itself is very simple. You are a block thing that shoots
a crazy number of... "bullets". You are attempting to shut down the
turrets (so far; more content coming), and continue on. 

So far, that's about it. There is some effort to increase difficulty
over the course of many levels, and a bit more built in for other
future uses but unused in the game in its current state. 

As of this writing, there aren't many levels in the game, but more 
will come. And the source is available at github anyway if you want
to copy or otherwise clone or extend the game yourself. It's ugly, 
unorganized, and totally a product of the short LD timeframe, but 
it's there.

Please provide attribution and share alike with any derivative 
works, including this README file. Essentially a (CC)BY-SA license.

Controls, again, are arrow keys and 'A' to shoot. The game was 
tested with an XBox 360 control pad... 'A' again to shoot, and 
the analog stick to move. 

Leftover from debugging: 'Y' on the gamepad to wipe out all 
existing lingering bullets. Also, holding down right trigger, then
pressing the left trigger will reset the game to the start of the
first level.

Browser I tested in was Chrome (Windows) and Chrome alone.

This game was not tested at ALL on mobile. I may add touch controls
in the future, if there's interest, but the effects used in the game
may not allow reasonable framerates on many mobile devices. It's
probably a fixable problem, but may not be worth it.

If you have feature requests, questions, or any other feedback at
at all, I'm wide-open. Please remember this was a simple idea made
in less than 48 hours... so keep it constructive. :P
