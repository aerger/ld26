This is my entry for Ludum Dare #26, theme "Minimalism".

I've just started putting this together, don't know if I'll
get back to this README or not, and have no idea if I'll even
finish the game. I have a basic game idea, but it's not at all
fleshed out beyond a thought in my head.

Good luck to you all, and if you read this, hello, and nice to
see you. 


Thanks!
